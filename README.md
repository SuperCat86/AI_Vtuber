# AI_Vtuber
This is an AI virtual anchor based on OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model and using Microsoft's TTS as the speech engine. <br>
The reason for using the text-davinci-003 model is that the model provides fine-tuning, and you can collect data sets <br>
yourself to customize your Personalized AI virtual anchor.<br><br>

The program running log will be saved in logs.txt<br>
The generated audio file will be played by mpv.exe<br><br>

If you want to output the audio to the bilibili live broadcast room, you can try to install a virtual sound card<br>
